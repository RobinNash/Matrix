# Matrix
This repository holds a Python modules matrix.py. This module allows users to create matrix objects, perform matrix and vector operations, and easily perform elementary row operations on a matrix.

To create a Matrix object, cast Matrix to a 2D list.
For example, the 2x3 matix:

  1 2 3

  4 5 6
  
would be written as Matrix(\[\[1, 2, 3],\[4, 5, 6]]).
